This project is a list of samples for computational physics starting from projectile motion all the way to modern physics (optics, quantum mechanics, general relativity, particle physics, etc.). Raylib may be used in the beginning, but later on, Ogre3d will be used due to its feature rich 3d capabilities. In quantum mechanics, C++ will not be used; I have not decided what language to use for quantum mechanics.
